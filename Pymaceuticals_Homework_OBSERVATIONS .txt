Pymaceuticals Homework : OBSERVATIONS 
April Doster


1) Capomul√≠n was the most effective in shrinking tumors. (Infubinol and Ketapril were very similar to the placebo)
2) Capomulin showed the best efficacy on slowing down the metastatic spread (remaining below 1.5 met sites after 45 days of treatment). Infubinol was the next best.
3) Capomulin gave the best survival rate of the three drugs, during treatment, as it remained over 85% survival rate during treatment. Ketapril provided slightly better survival rates than the placebo but Infubinol gave the worst survival rates.

SUMMARY:
1) The most effective drug is Capomulin; visible shrinking of tumors, with low increases in metastatic spreads and a survival rate over 80% 
2) Ketapril is the least effective drug; showed no visible shrinking, increases in metastatic spreads and very low survival rate (less than 50%) 
3) While Infubinol showed better results than Ketapril, its efficacy is slightly better than a placebo so is NOT considered a candidate for patients.
